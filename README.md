# Graph-Theory-Applied-on-Big-Data-Building-a-Fiber-Optic-Tower-to-grid-Network
In this project we were interested in minimizing the amount of fiber optic cable when building the tower-to-grid network. We first found all cell tower coordinates. We extracted power grid from image and mapped it to an array of long/lat coordinates. Finally, we used a hybrid minimum spanning tree algorithm to calculate shortest distance of each cell tower to its closest power grid.
